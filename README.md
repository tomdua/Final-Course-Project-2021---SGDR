# SGDR: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Restarts
Lasagne implementation of SGDR on WRNs from "SGDR: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Restarts" by Ilya Loshchilov and Frank Hutter (http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983)  
This code is based on Lasagne Recipes available at
https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/blob/master/papers/deep_residual_learning/Deep_Residual_Learning_CIFAR-10.py
and on WRNs implementation by Florian Muellerklein available at
